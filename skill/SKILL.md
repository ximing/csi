  cdp-bridge lets AI control the user's real Chrome browser — navigate, click, type, read, screenshot, save as PDF, and interact with any website using the user's actual login sessions. Use this skill whenever the user wants to interact with websites, automate browser tasks, scrape web content, or perform any action requiring a real browser. Also use when the user mentions "browser", "webpage", "open URL", "screenshot", or asks to read/interact with any website. Use even for simple-sounding browser requests — the daemon handles all complexity.

# cdp-bridge

Control the user's real Chrome browser (with their login sessions) via a local daemon at `http://127.0.0.1:10088`.

## Tools

| Tool | Args | Returns | Note |
|------|------|---------|------|
| `navigate` | `url`*, `newTab`(bool), `group_title` | `{success, url, tabId, frameId?}` | First call opens a tab — see [Tabs](#tabs-and-the-current-tab). `group_title` sets the group's visible label. Waits for page load (30s timeout) |
| `find_tab` | `url`*, `active`(bool) | `{success, url, tabId, borrowed}` | Re-select a tab **this session** opened; `active:true` borrows the tab the **user** is viewing — see [Tabs](#tabs-and-the-current-tab) |
| `snapshot` | — | `{url, title, tree}` with `@e` refs | **Accessibility tree** (text) — use this to read page content and locate elements |
| `click` | `selector`* (@e ref or CSS) | `{success, tag, text}` | Synthetic DOM-level `el.click()` |
| `fill` | `selector`*, `value`* | `{success, tag, mode}` | Works on `<input>`/`<textarea>` AND `[contenteditable]` (ProseMirror/Lexical/Slate). `mode` is `"value"` or `"contenteditable"` |
| `evaluate` | `code`* (supports async/await) | `{type, value}` | `Runtime.evaluate` with `awaitPromise:true` |
| `network` | `cmd`* (start\|stop\|list\|detail), `filter`, `requestId` | request/response data | `detail` returns `{requestId, url, method, status, mimeType, base64Encoded, body}` |
| `mouse_click` | `selector`* (@e ref or CSS) | `{success, x, y, tag, text}` | Coordinate-level `Input.dispatchMouseEvent` — passes `isTrusted` checks |
| `key_type` | `text`* | `{success, length}` | `Input.insertText` — types text at the focused element |
| `send_keys` | `keys`*, `repeat`(1-100) | `{success, dispatched, os}` | `Enter`/`Escape`/`Tab`/`F1-F12`/single letters+digits, modifiers `Alt/Ctrl/Cmd/Meta/Shift/Mod` (`Mod` auto-resolves to Cmd on macOS, Ctrl elsewhere), space-separated combos — see [Special keys](#form-submit--special-keys) |
| `cdp` | `method`*, `params` | raw CDP response | Raw CDP passthrough — what `evaluate` is to JS, `cdp` is to CDP. Low-level escape hatch for cases the tools above don't cover |
| `screenshot` | `format`(png\|jpeg), `quality`(0-100), optional `selector` (@e/CSS), optional `path` | `{format, path, sizeBytes, mimeType}` | Returns a file path, not base64 — see [Screenshots](#screenshots) |
| `save_as_pdf` | `paper_format`, `landscape`, `scale`, `print_background`, `file_name`, optional `path` | `{path, sizeBytes, mimeType, pageTitle}` | Render current page → PDF, returns a file path — see [Save as PDF](#save-the-current-page-as-pdf) |
| `upload` | `selector`*, `files`*(string[]) | `{success, selector, fileCount, files}` | `DOM.setFileInputFiles` on a file input |
| `list_tabs` | — | `{success, tabs:[{tabId, url, title, active, groupTitle}]}` | Inspect tabs in the current session |
| `close_tab` | — | `{success, closed, reason?}` | Close the current tab in the session |
| `close_session` | — | `{success, closed}` | Close all tabs in the session — see [Sessions](#sessions) for when to call |

`*` marks required args.

### Tabs and the current tab

Single-tab tools (`snapshot`, `click`, `fill`, `screenshot`, `save_as_pdf`) act on the **current tab** — the one you most recently opened with `navigate` or selected with `find_tab`.

- **Opening pages**: use `newTab:true` when pages should coexist (comparing, cross-referencing); omit it to send the current tab to a new URL. On `chrome://` / `edge://` pages, `navigate` always opens a new tab.
- **Going back to an earlier tab**: call `find_tab` to make a tab **you opened earlier in this session** the current one again. Pass the tab's **full URL** — take it from `list_tabs` or the earlier `navigate` result. A bare root domain (`example.com`) may miss a `www.example.com` tab, so prefer the exact URL. By default `find_tab` searches **only this session's own tabs** — it never reaches into the user's other tabs or windows.
- **Acting on a page the user already has open**: pass `active:true` ("use my open X tab" / "the X page I'm viewing"). It **borrows** the tab the user is currently viewing (returns `borrowed:true`); the borrowed tab is operated in place — it is not pulled into the session's tab group.
- If `find_tab` errors with "no tab matching … in this session", the page isn't open in this session — `navigate` with `newTab:true` instead.

```bash
curl -s -X POST http://127.0.0.1:10088/command \
  -d '{"action":"find_tab","args":{"url":"https://www.example.com","active":true},"session":"my-task"}'
```

### Call Format

Every command carries a top-level `session` naming the current task — see [Sessions](#sessions) below. The examples in later sections omit it only for brevity; in real calls always include it. The command format depends on the user's OS.

**macOS / Linux** — inline JSON is fine:

```bash
curl -s -X POST http://127.0.0.1:10088/command \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"action":"navigate","args":{"url":"https://example.com","newTab":true,"group_title":"My task"},"session":"my-task"}'
```

Success and failure both come back as HTTP 200 with a JSON body: `{ "success": true, "data": {...} }` or `{ "success": false, "error": "..." }`. Always check the `success` field, not the HTTP status.

**Windows (PowerShell / cmd)** — the shell corrupts non-ASCII characters (Chinese etc.) carried inline in command arguments or pipes; they reach the daemon as `?` and the text is unrecoverable. Send **every** request as a file body instead:

1. Write the JSON body to a **uniquely-named** temp file with your own file-write tool — never with shell `echo`/heredoc, which corrupts non-ASCII the same way. Give **every** request its own filename with a random suffix (e.g. `cdp-bridge-req-<random>.json`) so concurrent requests never share a file and overwrite each other.
2. POST the file with `curl.exe` — always `curl.exe`, never bare `curl`, which Windows PowerShell aliases to `Invoke-WebRequest`:

```powershell
curl.exe -s -X POST http://127.0.0.1:10088/command -H "Content-Type: application/json" --data-binary "@$env:TEMP\cdp-bridge-req-<random>.json"
```

3. Delete the temp file as soon as the request returns — don't leave request bodies on disk.

## Sessions

**One task = one session = one tab group.** A `session` collects every tab the task opens into one tab group (`agent:<session>`), so the user sees a single group for "what the agent is doing right now". Pass it as a **top-level field** of the request body (not inside `args`). It defaults to `"default"` if omitted — always set it explicitly.

- **Pick one session name at the task's start, put it on every command, and never switch mid-task — even across different sites.** Switching session names per site is the #1 cause of fragmented tab groups.
- Name it after the **task**, not the site (`camping-research`, `phone-compare`). Use multiple sessions only for genuinely unrelated parallel tasks.
- `group_title` is the human-readable group label — write it in the user's language, on the **first** `navigate` of the task.
- When you create the group (the first `navigate` of a task), tell the user once that this task's pages are collected under group «title», and that you'll close them whenever they ask.

```bash
# First tab: set session + a human label (in the user's language)
curl -s -X POST http://127.0.0.1:10088/command \
  -d '{"action":"navigate","args":{"url":"https://example.com","newTab":true,"group_title":"Feature research"},"session":"feature-research"}'
# Another site, same task → same session → joins the same group automatically
curl -s -X POST http://127.0.0.1:10088/command \
  -d '{"action":"navigate","args":{"url":"https://example.org","newTab":true},"session":"feature-research"}'
```

Closing is always user-initiated: call `close_session` only when the user explicitly asks ("close those", "clear the tabs"). It clears the whole group in one call.

## Screenshots

The daemon writes the image to disk and returns `{format, path, sizeBytes, mimeType}` — never base64, since the model can't read raw image bytes. Take the `.path` and open it with the `Read` tool to actually see it.

```bash
# Default: PNG of the visible viewport, daemon picks a temp path
curl ... -d '{"action":"screenshot","args":{}}'
# Options (each independent): JPEG quality, element-only via @e/CSS selector, custom output path
curl ... -d '{"action":"screenshot","args":{"format":"jpeg","quality":60}}'
curl ... -d '{"action":"screenshot","args":{"selector":"@e123"}}'
```

A caller-supplied `path` is honored verbatim (parent dirs created, existing file overwritten) — use a unique name to avoid clobbering. `save_as_pdf` follows the same rule.

## Prefer snapshot over CSS/JS selectors

`snapshot` returns interactive elements with `@e` refs based on semantic role/name. Use them directly with click/fill — they survive CSS class hash changes that break manually-written selectors.

Fall back to `evaluate` (JS) only when:
- The target has no `@e` ref in the snapshot
- You need attributes not in the snapshot (e.g., `href`)
- You need to dispatch complex event sequences, or scroll

## Evaluate Tips

- Always use compact `JSON.stringify(data)` — never add `null, 2` formatting. Indentation and newlines can inflate the response several times over, causing truncation during transmission.
- `evaluate` calls share the page's JS realm — re-declaring the same `const`/`let` across two calls throws `SyntaxError`. Wrap in an IIFE for a fresh scope: `(() => { const x = ...; return x; })()`.
- `evaluate` (and `cdp`) is an arbitrary code execution channel in the page — that is by design, but use it deliberately.

## Text input — use `fill`

`fill` (selector = CSS or `@e` ref, plus the value) works on `<input>`/`<textarea>` (returns `mode: "value"`) and on `[contenteditable]` rich editors — ProseMirror, TipTap, Lexical, Slate, Quill, etc. (returns `mode: "contenteditable"`), firing the right input events so the page reacts.

`fill` is **clear-and-insert**: existing content is replaced. To append, read the current value via `evaluate`, concatenate, then `fill` with the result.

For plain typing into the already-focused element, `key_type` (`Input.insertText`) also works — but prefer `fill`, which targets a specific element.

## Form submit / special keys

Use `send_keys` to press special keys. `keys` is a space-separated sequence of key combos, each combo being modifiers joined to a key with `+`:

- Keys: `Enter`, `Escape`, `Tab`, `Backspace`, `Delete`, `F1`-`F12`, arrow keys, and single letters/digits (`a`, `5`).
- Modifiers: `Alt`, `Ctrl`, `Cmd`, `Meta`, `Shift`, and `Mod` (auto-resolves to `Cmd` on macOS, `Ctrl` elsewhere).
- `repeat` (1-100, default 1) repeats the whole sequence.

```bash
# Submit a form with Enter
{"action":"send_keys","args":{"keys":"Enter"}}
# Select all + copy
{"action":"send_keys","args":{"keys":"Mod+a Mod+c"}}
# Press Tab three times
{"action":"send_keys","args":{"keys":"Tab","repeat":3}}
```

Alternatively, dispatch a key event programmatically with `evaluate`:

```bash
{"action":"evaluate","args":{"code":"document.activeElement.dispatchEvent(new KeyboardEvent('keydown',{key:'Escape',bubbles:true}))"}}
```

## Save the current page as PDF

`save_as_pdf` renders the current page to PDF and returns the file path. All args optional:
- `paper_format`: `letter` (default) \| `a4` \| `legal` \| `a3` \| `tabloid`
- `landscape`: `false` (default)
- `scale`: `1.0` (default), range `[0.1, 2.0]`
- `print_background`: `true` (default) — keep background colors
- `file_name`: override the output file name (default: sanitized page title + `.pdf`)
- `path`: caller-supplied output path; if absent, daemon picks a default under OS temp dir

`path` semantics match `screenshot`: written verbatim, parent dirs auto-created, existing files overwritten.

Decoded PDF cap is 100 MB. Above that the daemon refuses; reduce `scale` or split the page.

## Known limitations

- **Sites that strictly check `event.isTrusted`** (some banking portals, captchas) ignore `click` / `fill` because those fire DOM-level synthetic events (`isTrusted=false`). Use `mouse_click` instead — it dispatches trusted input events at the coordinate level via CDP.
- **Cross-origin iframes**: `fill`, `click`, `evaluate`, and `snapshot` operate on the top frame. If a target element lives in a same-page iframe from a different origin (e.g. embedded sandbox demos), navigate to the iframe's URL directly instead.

## If a tool call fails (daemon not ready)

**If a tool call can't reach the daemon (connection refused), start it yourself — don't ask the user. This is safe to run anytime: it no-ops if the daemon is already up.**

**macOS / Linux:**

```bash
~/.cdp-bridge/bin/cdp-bridge start
```

**Windows (PowerShell):**

```powershell
& "$env:USERPROFILE\.cdp-bridge\bin\cdp-bridge.exe" start
```

Then retry the tool call. If it still fails — or the browser extension won't connect — check `references/operations.md` for recovery steps, and ask the user to verify the cdp-bridge extension is installed and enabled in Chrome (`chrome://extensions`) and shows "connected" in its popup.

Never run `stop` / `restart` / `uninstall` automatically — those kill a running daemon. See `references/operations.md` for anything deeper.
